## A UWA Beamer Template

 - This is a template for LaTeX [Beamer](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer)
 - Beamer LaTeX for slideshows.
 - UWA has [rules and tempates](http://www.brand.uwa.edu.au/) on use of its branding.
     - those templates do not include one for beamer, thus this.
