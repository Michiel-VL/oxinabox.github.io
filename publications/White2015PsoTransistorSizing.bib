abstract={We describe an application of particle swarm optimisation to the problem of determining the optimal sizing of transistors in an integrated circuit. The algorithm minimises the total area of silicon utilised by a given circuit, whilst maintaining the propagation delay of the circuit within a hard limit. It assesses designs using the well-known circuit simulation engine SPICE, making allowance for the inability of SPICE to assess poorly-designed circuits within a reasonable timeframe. Experiments on three different types of circuits demonstrate that the algorithm is able to derive excellent designs for a range of problem instances, including several problems where the Monte Carlo method is unable to find any feasible solutions at all.},
