title: Modelling Sentence Generation from Sum of Word Embedding Vectors as a Mixed Integer Programming Problem
subtitle: Supplementary Material
---

This page contains supplementary material, code and data used in [White et. al. 2016, Modelling Sentence Generation from Sum of Word Embedding Vectors as a Mixed Integer Programming Problem](../White2016SOWE2Sent.pdf).

I'm very happy for anyone with any interest in this (or any of my other work) to [get in touch with me]({{site.url}}/contact).



## Additional Qualitative Comparisons
Additional comparisons were run against the examples from the related works of others.
Since they are several large tables, they didn't fit into the paper.
I do hope they are enlightening on the difference in performance of the methods.

## Raw Results and Code

The below includes the code used in this research.
It is made available under the [CRAPL](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/);
use of the code for academic pursuits should of course cite the paper.
It also includes all the raw results, which the paper summarises.
It is implemented in the [Julia programming language](http://julialang.org/).
