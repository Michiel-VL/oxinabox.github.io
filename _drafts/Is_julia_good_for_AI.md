It seems like one of the most common questions asked of Julia: "Is Julia good for AI?".
I'm not sure why it is asked so often.
Cynically, I think it is asked by people who are both new to the language and new to the field.
The question can't be readily answered without first defining AI.


AI is notoriously hard to define:
I'll quote Wikipedia's article on the AI Effect:

>The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence.
>Author Pamela McCorduck writes: "It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'." AI researcher Rodney Brooks complains "Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'"

However, that is a question of the lay-persons definition of AI.
Even the definitions of people in the field make AI a broad area.
